## Exercise:

Open the exercise notebook in Colab and start the TODO items [![Open the notebook in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/quentinf00/lightning-tensorboard-workshop/blob/main/mnist.ipynb)

- **TODO 0** -> Log the metrics and hyperparams in tensorboard
- **TODO 1** -> Execute the training on GPU
- **TODO 2** -> Log the test confusion matrix image
- **TODO 3** -> save the best weight of the model
- **TODO 4** -> Log the graph of the model
- **TODO 5** -> Log the images of the worst prediction
- **TODO 6** -> Log the profile (GPU memory, CPU usage...) on a training step in tensorboard


## Solutions:

The solutions can be found on the branches todo-[0-6]-sol
And the final notebook on the branch all-solutions
